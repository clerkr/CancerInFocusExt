Due to automated data collection efforts, years on sources will change over time. The years given here represent the most recently available data and reflect what is found on <a href="https://cancerinfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer InFocus: Catchment Areas</a>.

		    <h2><strong><em>Cancer Incidence and Mortality</em></strong></h2>

		    <h4><a href="https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State Cancer Profiles (SCP)</a></h4>

		    <p>SCP is an interactive map engine produced in collaboration between the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was developed with the idea to provide a geographic profile of cancer burden in the United States and reveal geographic disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, risk factors for cancer, and cancer screening, across different population subgroups. The target audiences are health planners, policy makers, and cancer information providers who need quick and easy access to cancer related data and maps to inform and prioritize investments in cancer control.</p>

		    <p>Cancer incidence data from SCP used in Cancer InFocus comes from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results SEER*Stat Database and from the National Program of Cancer Registries where applicable. The most recently available incidence data are the 5-year average age-adjusted rates per 100,00 people for 2016-2020.</p>

		    <p>Cancer mortality data from SCP used in Cancer InFocus comes from the National Vital Statistics System public use data file. The most recently available mortality data are the 5-year age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 people for 2016-2020.</p>

		    <p>ACS is a nationally representative sample of households that are randomly selected to participate. This survey provides population estimates of demographic information for various geographic areas, aggregated over five consecutive years. </p>

		    <p>Cancer InFocus contains the following indicators from the ACS. The most recently available ACS data are the 2017-2021 5-year estimates:</p>

		    <p>Economic Segregation, Racial Segregation, and Racial Economic Segregation as indices referred to collectively as Indices of Concentrations at the Extremes. These are intended to look at the difference in the proportions of most versus least privileged individuals in an area. For Economic Segregation, most privileged is defined as annual income over $150,000, whereas least privileged is annual income under $30,000. For Racial Segregation, most privileged is White race and least privileged is Black race. For Racial Economic Segregation, most privileged is White race with annual income over $150,000 and least privileged is Black race with annual income under $30,000. These indices range between -1 and +1, with values approaching +1 showing segregation towards greater privilege and values approaching -1 showing segregation towards less privilege.</p>

		    <p>Gender Pay Gap measures the cents fewer on the dollar that the median female in an area makes per dollar the median male in that area makes. Positive values indicate that the median male makes more than the median female; negative values indicate that the median female makes more than the median male.</p>

		    <h4><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLACES</a></h4>

		    <p>PLACES is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation. PLACES provides health data for small areas across the country. This allows local health departments and jurisdictions, regardless of population size and rurality, to better understand the burden and geographic distribution of health measures in their areas and assist them in planning public health interventions.</p>

		    <p>PLACES provides model-based, population-level analysis and community estimates of health measures to all counties, places (incorporated and census designated places), census tracts, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) across the United States.</p>

		    <p>Cancer InFocus contains the following indicators from the PLACES, which are based off of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System:</p>

		    <p>The Mammography Quality Standards Act requires mammography facilities across the nation to meet uniform quality standards. Congress passed this law in 1992 to assure high-quality mammography for early breast cancer detection, which can lead to early treatment, a range of treatment options, and increased chances of survival. Under the law, all mammography facilities must: 1) be accredited by an FDA-approved accreditation body, 2) be certified by FDA, or its State, as meeting the standards, 3) undergo an annual MQSA inspection, and 4) prominently display the certificate issued by the agency.</p>

		    <p>Cancer InFocus uses the location data for Mammography Sites from the FDA Certified Mammography Facilities list. This data is updated on a weekly basis to reflect real-time presence of mammography facilities.</p>

		      <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52492234247_c430d09ed5_h.jpg" alt="Cancer InFocus" style="width:50vw; margin-bottom: 52px;">
		      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 44px;">ABOUT US</h1>
		      <p style="text-align: justify;">Cancer InFocus is a data gathering and visualization platform designed to make understanding the cancer burden in a geographic area easier through a rapid and repeatable process of tool creation. This platform was developed by the Community Impact Office at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, and is made available to others through CancerInFocus.org (for data downloads) and a no-cost licensing agreement (for access to data gathering and application creation code). </p>
		      <hr>
		    </div>

		    <h2><strong><em>What It Does</em></strong></h2>

		    <p>Cancer InFocus begins with a data gathering program known as CIFTools. This program receives a set of US counties as an input and uses that input to pull and filter data from numerous publicly available online sources, such as the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, CDC Places, the FDA Certified Mammography facility list, and more (see available data sources <a href="https://cancerinfocus.org/datasources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). Data is then processed into a standard format, organized by category and geographic level, and written to files for use.</p>

		    <p>After the data files are produced, they can be used independently or read into the Cancer InFocus Shiny application code (see below) to create an interactive mapping application. This application can be deployed online for use by anyone interested in better understanding the impacts of cancer where they live and work.</p>

		    <p>The generalized nature and rapid processing of these tools allows data and applications to be easily updated over time, making the workflow of characterizing the cancer burden in an area more efficient. Increased efficiency means less time spent gathering data and building tools and more time spent on working to improve cancer outcomes.</p>

		    <hr>

		    <h2><strong><em>How You Can Use It</em></strong></h2>

		    <p>There are two ways in which cancer centers and other interested parties can take advantage of the data gathering aspect of Cancer InFocus. Data has already been gathered and made available for download for the defined catchment areas of all NCI-designated cancer centers <a href="https://cancerinfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> . Additional cancer centers that are not NCI-designated can request to have their catchment/service areas added to this application by emailing <a href="mailto:ciodata@uky.edu">ciodata@uky.edu</a>.</p>

		    <p>Researchers can also request access to the code behind the data gathering process by filling out the following <a href="https://redcap.uky.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=FEE7KWDKRYFN88LE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">request form </a>.

		    </p><p>If a cancer center is interested in creating their own site-specific version of the Cancer InFocus interactive mapping application <a href="https://cancerinfocus.uky.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(example)</a>, they may do so through the completion of a no-cost licensing agreement with the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center. The licensing form may be obtained by emailing <a href="mailto:ciodata@uky.edu">ciodata@uky.edu</a>. Centers who license access to the Cancer InFocus Shiny application code will be responsible for deploying and maintaining their own versions of Cancer InFocus.</p>
